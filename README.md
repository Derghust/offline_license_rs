![Offline License RS](docs/image_without_background.png)

**Offline license RS** is mainly inspired by [license-key](https://github.com/patriksvensson/license-key) rust library 
and [Implementing a Partial Serial Number Verification System in Delphi](https://www.brandonstaggs.com/2007/07/26/implementing-a-partial-serial-number-verification-system-in-delphi/)
blog.

**Offline license RS** is able to generate license key for your product without validating
it with network connection. It is also important to say that this method will not 
prevent **Cracking** or **Unauthorized distributing** of your software also known as `PIRACY`.
